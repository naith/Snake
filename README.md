# Snake Game in Godot with C#

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game, developed using the Godot game engine and C#.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several C# scripts that handle different aspects of the game:

- `Base.cs`: This script contains the main game logic, including the game's score and the position of the apple in the game.

- `ButtonStart.cs`: This script handles the functionality of the start button in the game. When the button is pressed, the game begins.

- `SnakeHead.cs`: This script manages the movement and behavior of the snake's head. It also handles the addition of new segments to the snake's body when it eats an apple.

## How to Run

To run this project, you need to have Godot installed on your machine. Open the project in Godot, and press the "Play" button.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is simple: use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible. The game ends when the snake hits the edge of the screen or its own body.

## Future Improvements

This project is a basic implementation of the Snake game. There are many potential improvements and features that could be added, such as:

- Adding a high score system
- Implementing different difficulty levels
- Adding more types of food with different effects
